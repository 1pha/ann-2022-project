# ANN 2022 Classification Problem

I was assigned with GoogleNet, a.k.a. Inception model to increase performance of retianl dataset which is to classify diabetic retinopathy from fundus images.
Since GoogleNet was released in 2014, there has been tremendous works to increase performance other than the model structure such as data augmentation, scheduling learning rate or more optimizers[^1].
