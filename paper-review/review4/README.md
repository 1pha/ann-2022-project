# Chinese Room Argument

Everyone, please summarize the following exposition on the Chinese Room Argument.

[Chinese Room Argument | Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy](https://iep.utm.edu/chinese-room-argument/)

Your summary can draw on other resources if you like, but I would like it to include:

- summary of the Chinese Room by Searle

- summary of replies

- summary of the Conclusion from the Encyclopedia article

This part should be about one page

- which of these replies makes most sense to YOU??

Write a least half a page on justifying what YOUR conclusion is in light of the arguments presented in the article. 

Again, send your document as PDF to christian.wallraven+ANNS2022@gmail.com by Thursday morning, June 2nd, 11am!
